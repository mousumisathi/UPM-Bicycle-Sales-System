  <br/>
<h4 style= "text-align: center">What Are the Benefits of Cycling?</h4>
<br/>
<p>There are a lot of excellent reasons to take up riding bikes:</p>
<p>It’s a great and healthy way to move from point A to point B.</p>
<p>It’s free – no gas to put in, no parking spaces to pay for.</P>
<p>It’s low impact on your body. There are no jarring-impact moments like with running.</P>
<p>It’s a great place to start with exercise. Sit on bike. Pedal. Done.</P>
<p>It’s fun!</P>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4 style= "text-align: center">What are the things also should buy for cycyling</h4>
<br/>
<p>After initially purchasing a bike, there are a few other things you should consider. 
</p>
<p> 1. Helmet – it is imperative to own and wear a helmet when cycling. </p>
<p> 2. U-Lock – One of the most awesome things about riding bikes to get places is that you don’t have to park a car. You can just ride right up to the place, lock your bike, and go inside. You will need a lock if you’d like your bike to be there when you come out, though. </P>
<p> 3. Blinky Lights – Get yourself a good set of blinky lights for your bike.It’s wise to have lights in these cases, so that you can be as visible as possible on the roadway. </P>
<p> 4. Clippy Shoes – If you’re going to ride often, eventually it’s wise to switch to clipless pedals and shoes. </P>
<p> 5. Lycra – If you’re doing any amount of riding at all, I recommend getting yourself a pair of bibs. Cycling shorts are nice too (they both have a chamois) but bib shorts are the ultimate in comfort.</P>

<h4 style= "text-align: center">6 Perfect Ways to Warm-Up Before Cycling</h4>
<p> How do you warm up for cycling? Start with stretches before any other warm-up exercise. Stretching helps your muscles loosen up, allowing for better flow of muscle activity &amp; blood circulation.There are four types of stretches you can do to ensure an optimum physique while you go on your ride. </p>
<p> Static Stretches :- Static stretches are ones that you can hold for a long period of time, normally between 10-30 seconds. The positions involved in static stretches are normally ones that are comfortable, yet challenging to the right degree. Static stretches are the most common form of stretching and are found to be the ideal cool-down exercise for a majority of fitness activities, since they focus on slowing your muscles down after a heavy workout. </p>
<p>Dynamic Stretches:- Dynamic stretches are stretches that involve repetitive motions in a comfortable position. Normally, each stretch is repeated for a total of 10-12 times. These stretches are believed to boost the functional range of motion along with added mobility, agility &amp; stamina, and are therefore performed increasingly by athletes, trainers and fitness lovers. However, dynamic stretching should not be confused with the old school tradition of ballistic stretching. Ballistic stretches involved exercises such as bouncing toe touches and are entirely different from dynamic stretches; they're also rapidly losing popularity due to newer stretching formats. When performing dynamic stretches, your movements are going to be smooth, controlled, and deliberate as opposed to the uneven, jerky forms of ballistic stretches. </p>
<p> Passive stretching:- When you're engaged in passive stretching, you're normally using some sort of external assistance while executing your forms. An external assistance could be anything from a strap, a yoga brick, leverage or even your own body weight &amp; gravity. During passive stretching, you're relaxing the exact muscle that you're trying to stretch while depending fully on the external assistance to maintain your position. Although passive stretching is a relatively easier form of this exercise, there's always the possible risk of your external assistance having a higher level of strength than you have when it comes to your flexibility. Therefore, expert guidance is strongly recommended. </p>
<p> Active stretching:- Active stretching solely involves your body and your physical strength along with inner, muscular stretch. This involves actually contracting the muscle opposite to the one that you're stretching. You depend on the muscle opposite to the one you want to relax to initiate the stretch, therefore building muscular force and adding to your strength. However, active stretching is always considered lower in risk value since there's no external assistance involved, and it only involves you and the natural force from your body. </p>
<h8 style= "text-align: left">Leg Swings:- </h8>
<p>  You can always start off with a simple hip-flexor stretch that loosens up the muscle for activity. Support yourself on one side with a bar or even your cycle, and swing the opposite leg outward and backwards, making sure your knee and leg are straight at all times. Repeat the exercise at least 10 times per leg.</p>
<h8 style= "text-align: left">Squats for that perfect ride:-</h8>
<p>  Squats are effective for cycling since it's your thighs, hips &amp; knees that are used the most for this activity, often for a longer period of time.  </p>
<p>  Bodyweight Squat:- Stand with your feet slightly wider apart than your hips. Your toes should be pointed to in a about 5 - 20 degree outward direction. Focus on a spot on the wall right in front of you, and gradually squat as low and possible while keeping your spine as straight as possible. Finding a focus spot helps you stay upright while maintaining your muscular composure.</p>
<p> 
Barbell Squat:- The barbell squat uses the barbell tool, and it's the placement of the equipment that determines which <p>muscle groups are activated while you perform your squats. Begin by stepping up to the bar with your face towards it; Grip the bar by stepping under it, avoiding a thumb grip in order to align the forearms with the wrists perfectly. Depending on your flexibility, the width of your grip will be different, and it's always ideal to go with the grip that's most comfortable for you. Now, tighten your core, step back, and form the same position as you did for the bodyweight squat. Find your focus point from earlier, and repeat the same squatting position as before. Make sure you start with gradual movements, building up the pressure as you go. Repeating it at least 10 times will provide the best effects and strengthen not just your knees and thighs, but also your core, back and biceps.
  </p>
  <h8 style= "text-align: left">Butt-kicks:- </h8>
<p> Butt-kicks work best for loosening up your thighs, hip flexor, hamstrings and butt muscles. This well-known cardio exercise is especially known to strengthen the hamstrings, therefore increasing your cycling speed. It also works your glutes and quads and helps to thoroughly prepare them for rapid movement, which is a requirement if you're going to cycle in India, given the traffic and uneven roads. Whether you're doing your butt kicks in one place or over a set distance, you'll be boosting your heart rate, burning calories and increasing your metabolic rate. Start by standing upright and bring one heel to your glutes while the opposite arm is raised towards your shoulder in a form similar to the way it is while running. Immediately switch to the other side and repeat. Ideally, it's best to repeat butt kicks for at least a minute for optimum warming up and heart rate acceleration. </p>
  <h8 style= "text-align: left">Jumping Jacks:- </h8>
  <p> Jumping jacks have long been known for their benefits involving all the muscles of your body. From the feet, legs and torso to your upper body, spine and arms, jumping jacks are the perfect way to loosen up your entire body through one single activity. Here's how to get into this fun yet active warm-up exercise and get all set for your ride. Standing with your feet together, rest your arms by your sides, parallel to your torso. Jump up while widening the distance between your legs and raising your arms up and away from your head. Try to keep both your legs and arms as straight as possible. After the jump, bring both your arms and legs back to your original resting position. Repeat at least 10 times you could also divide this exercise into sets of 10 or 20 for optimum heart rate acceleration.

<h4 style= "text-align: left">How to Ride a Bike</h4>
<p> Let’s explain some more tips for smooth bike riding:</p>
<p> 1) Use your rear brake to check your speed and your front one only if you really want to stop. If you grab a handful of front brake on a modern bike it might become a catapult.</p>
<p> 2) Remember when I said clippy shoes were worth it? It’s because they allow you to apply power throughout the whole revolution of the pedal, and to use your whole leg and butt to apply said power. They’re awesome.</p>
<p> 3) Keep in mind also that it’s more efficient to spin than to mash. This means that you’ll be able to deliver more power for longer if you ride in a smaller, easier gear at a higher cadence (RPM) than in a bigger, harder gear at a slower cadence.</p>
<p> 4) Your body should be pretty much still when you’re riding. Your knees should be in line between your hip and ankle, not out as if you’re trying to climb a pole</p>
